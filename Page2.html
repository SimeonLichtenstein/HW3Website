<p style ="color:orangered;font-size:22px">
    Now, this page is all aboout boats. Boats are used to float on the water. They are typically made of wood because wood is less dense than water
    so it floats. <br>
    The coolest kind of boat there ever was was the pirate ship. These ships would attack other boats and steal their booty. Pirates are a racket I think. <br>
    There once was a myth about the boat the Titanic. Everyone says it was fake and that Leonardo Decaprio didn't actually die, but I'm not sure if I believe them. <br>
    Not to be a conspiracy theorist or anything, but I think the Titanic actually happened. My friend Billy said he was there and saw it happen. <br>
    If the story that I was told is correct, the Titanic was a giant metal boat and the engineers were bragging that it could never sink. <br>
    So then they sailed the ocean blue and the rich people were having a party and the poor people were also there. <br>
    God then decided to drop a whole bunch of ice cubes in the water and one of them hit the hull, Dun dun dun!!!<br>
    The Titanic started to sink?! Uh oh, what's going to happen?<br>
    Long story short, it sank, even though they said it was impossible. <br>
    More rich people were able to get off of the boat because of classism but a lot of the poor people died. Shout out survival of the richest, no problems with that <br>
    Moral of the story, don't listen to rich people brag about how they are safe when doing dangerous things. Also boats.
