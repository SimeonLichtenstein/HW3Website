        Welcome to the World of Simeon!
    </h1>
    <p id = 'line1'>
        Grader, you are reading this site for a reason <br>
        For if you don't, it would be treason <br>
        So give me an A <br>
        I don't have all day <br>
        I've been wanting this all season <br>
        <br>
        From your spotted looking glass<br>
        You see a man with great class<br>
        I pin up my suit<br>
        and give a salute<br>
        and saunter to my ship of great mass<br>
        <br>
        I arrive to my destination<br>
        With pride I feel a great sensation<br>
        I step off the boat<br>
        Now I will gloat<br>
        For now my plans will start with no hesitation<br>
        <br>
        I set the stage<br>
        As I erect my homepage<br>
        With shape and style<br>
        I know you'll stay for a while<br>
        for this website that I raised<br>
        <br>
        I dare you to click the button below<br>
        For the site will go to a new flow<br>
        With a great twinkle of magic<br>
        You will have to have it<br>
        For I know that is where you will go<br>
        <br>
        The limericks are coming to an end<br>
        as all great things eventually suspend<br>
        But I hope you enjoyed your time<br>
        For me, it was sublime<br>
        And remember that an A you should send<br>
